## 🔄 Channel Swap
<a name="channel-swap"></a>

### Theoretical Foundation
In computer vision, we often encounter two color formats: RGB and BGR. They're like the order of names in different cultures - surname first or last. 😄

For a color image $I$, its RGB channels can be represented as:

$$
I_{RGB} = \begin{bmatrix}
R & G & B
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The channel swap operation can be represented as a matrix transformation:

$$
I_{BGR} = I_{RGB} \begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 \\
0 & 1 & 0 \\
1 & 0 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

### Implementation
```cpp
// C++ Implementation
vector<Mat> channels;
split(src, channels);
vector<Mat> new_channels = {
    channels[2],  // R
    channels[1],  // G
    channels[0]   // B
};
```

```python
# Python Implementation
b, g, r = cv2.split(img)
result = cv2.merge([r, g, b])
```

## 🌫️ Grayscale
<a name="grayscale"></a>

### Theoretical Foundation
Converting a color image to grayscale is like turning an oil painting into a sketch. We use weighted averaging because human eyes have different sensitivities to different colors.

The standard RGB to grayscale conversion formula:

$$
Y = 0.2126R + 0.7152G + 0.0722B
$$

This formula comes from the ITU-R BT.709 standard, considering human eye sensitivity to different wavelengths. A more general form is:

$$
Y = \sum_{i \in \{R,G,B\}} w_i \cdot C_i
$$

where $w_i$ are weight coefficients and $C_i$ are corresponding color channel values.

### Implementation
```cpp
// C++ Implementation
result.at<uchar>(y, x) = static_cast<uchar>(
    0.2126 * r + 0.7152 * g + 0.0722 * b
);
```

## ⚫⚪ Thresholding
<a name="thresholding"></a>

### Theoretical Foundation
Thresholding is like giving an image an ultimatum: it's either black or white, no middle ground!

Mathematical expression:

$$
g(x,y) = \begin{cases}
255, & \text{if } f(x,y) > T \\
0, & \text{if } f(x,y) \leq T
\end{cases}
$$

where:
- $f(x,y)$ is the input image grayscale value at point $(x,y)$
- $g(x,y)$ is the output image value at point $(x,y)$
- $T$ is the threshold value

### Implementation
```cpp
// C++ Implementation
result.at<uchar>(y, x) = (gray.at<uchar>(y, x) > threshold) ? 255 : 0;
```

## 🎯 Otsu's Method
<a name="otsu"></a>

### Theoretical Foundation
Otsu's method is like a "smart judge" that can automatically find the optimal threshold. It achieves this by maximizing the between-class variance.

The between-class variance formula:

$$
\sigma^2_B(t) = \omega_0(t)\omega_1(t)[\mu_0(t) - \mu_1(t)]^2
$$

where:
- $\omega_0(t)$ is the probability of foreground pixels
- $\omega_1(t)$ is the probability of background pixels
- $\mu_0(t)$ is the mean grayscale value of foreground pixels
- $\mu_1(t)$ is the mean grayscale value of background pixels

The optimal threshold selection:

$$
t^* = \arg\max_{t} \{\sigma^2_B(t)\}
$$

### Implementation
```cpp
// Calculate between-class variance
double variance = wBack * wFore * pow(meanBack - meanFore, 2);
```

## 🌈 HSV Transform
<a name="hsv"></a>

### Theoretical Foundation
HSV color space better matches human color perception, like turning RGB from a "tech geek" into an "artist".

RGB to HSV conversion formulas:

$$
V = \max(R,G,B)
$$

$$
S = \begin{cases}
\frac{V-\min(R,G,B)}{V}, & \text{if } V \neq 0 \\
0, & \text{if } V = 0
\end{cases}
$$

$$
H = \begin{cases}
60(G-B)/\Delta, & \text{if } V = R \\
120 + 60(B-R)/\Delta, & \text{if } V = G \\
240 + 60(R-G)/\Delta, & \text{if } V = B
\end{cases}
$$

where $\Delta = V - \min(R,G,B)$

### Implementation
```cpp
// Calculate HSV
float h = 0;
if (diff != 0) {
    if (maxVal == r) {
        h = 60 * (fmod(((g - b) / diff), 6));
    } else if (maxVal == g) {
        h = 60 * ((b - r) / diff + 2);
    } else {
        h = 60 * ((r - g) / diff + 4);
    }
}
```
